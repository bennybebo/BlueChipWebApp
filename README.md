## Introduction

`BlueChip` enables you to find the best price for a bet across several sports books and helps calculate mathematically profitable (+EV) bets.

BlueChip uses math and statistics to provide you with proper bet sizing as well as bet tracking tools that can compare your actual results against your expected value.Â

## Usage 
To use BlueChip, currently there is no website because I am frugal and don't want to pay to host the application or a higher rate API key. This will change in the future when the application is ready for a full release

## Development
This is a personal project and has no timeline or work schedule. However, contributions are welcome and development will continue.
